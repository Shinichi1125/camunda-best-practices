Ah â€” youâ€™ve just hit one of the most common confusions ðŸ˜Š
What youâ€™re seeing at **`http://localhost:8080`** is **Camunda Operate** (the monitoring UI). Thatâ€™s *not* where you edit BPMN diagrams.

---

### ðŸ”¹ Where BPMN diagrams live

* Each `.bpmn` file is **part of your codebase** (usually under `src/main/resources/` in a Spring Boot / Java project).
* Example path:

  ```
  src/main/resources/bpmn/PreviousProcess.bpmn
  ```
* Itâ€™s just an XML file that describes the process.

---

### ðŸ”¹ How to open/edit the diagram

1. Download and install **Camunda Modeler** (desktop app):
   ðŸ‘‰ [Camunda Modeler Download](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/)
   (Windows, macOS, Linux available).

2. Open Camunda Modeler, then:

   * File â†’ Open Fileâ€¦
   * Navigate to your repo, pick the `.bpmn` file (e.g., `PreviousProcess.bpmn`).
   * Boom ðŸŽ‰ â€” youâ€™ll see the visual diagram corresponding to that XML.

3. From there you can:

   * Drag gateways, tasks, flows.
   * Edit properties (like the condition expressions).
   * Save â†’ which updates the `.bpmn` file on disk.

4. When you re-run your Java project, Camunda will re-deploy the updated BPMN model (assuming itâ€™s on the classpath in `resources/`).

---

### ðŸ”¹ What you have right now

* **Operate** (`localhost:8080/operate`) â†’ Monitoring & troubleshooting running process instances.
* **Modeler** (desktop tool) â†’ Designing & editing `.bpmn` diagrams.

They complement each other:

* Design process in **Modeler** â†’ Save `.bpmn` â†’ Deploy/run app.
* Watch the process execute in **Operate**.

---

âœ… So answer to your question:
You wonâ€™t find the BPMN diagram editor inside Operate (the dashboard).
You need to **open the `.bpmn` file from your project in Camunda Modeler (the desktop tool)**.

---

Would you like me to show you how to **find all `.bpmn` files in your repo quickly** (e.g., via VS Code or Git Bash), so you can grab the right one and open it in Modeler?
