I've downloaded Camunda Modeler and opened one of the existing .bpmn files. 
When I make an any modification in the diagram that causes a code change in the corresponding .bpmn file, does git detect it?
If it does, to what extent are Camunda Modeler and local git synchronized?
For example, when a diagram is modified and the .bpmn file is also affected, if I undo the change by git stash, 
does it also automatically revert the change in the diagram?
Also, when git detects the code change with the modified diagram, will the version control see the file as unchanged 
once the diagram is reverted to the original state?
