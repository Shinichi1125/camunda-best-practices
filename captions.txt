3: The basics of BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) process execution
4: When you want business logic to live in Java code rather than BPMN condition expressions

10: What are the relationships between "incoming", "outgoing", "exclusiveGateway", "default", "BPMNEdge" etc?
11: Take the Flow_123abc example and turn it into a minimal diagram
12: .bpmn files are usually auto-generated (by Camunda Modeler)
13: Roadmap for changing the flow in Camunda Modeler tool
14: before vs. after in both a visual sketch and a BPMN XML snippet
15: What it looks like in Camunda Modeler’s UI
16: One of the most common confusions in Camunda
