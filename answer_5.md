Short answer: you can’t safely *assume* either of those without checking how the process is modeled and how the worker is implemented.

Here’s the nuance for Camunda 8 (Zeebe) job workers:

## 1) Where did `SOME_KEY` come from?

`job.getVariable(SOME_KEY)` reads a **process variable** that already exists in the process instance context. It could have been set by many things, for example:

* A **previous worker** that completed its job and included that variable in the completion payload
* The **start payload** of the process
* A **Message** correlation payload
* A **Form** submission / user task
* **Input/Output mappings** on BPMN elements
* A **call activity**/subprocess mapping

So yes, it’s common that a previous worker set it, but it’s not guaranteed to be “another worker” unless your BPMN + conventions say so.

## 2) Will `ANOTHER_KEY` be available to other workers later?

Only if you actually **persist it back into the process variables** when you complete the job.

In your snippet you have `autoComplete = true` and you’re doing:

```java
variableMap.put(ANOTHER_KEY, true);
```

Putting into a local `variableMap` does nothing by itself. With `autoComplete = true`, Spring Zeebe will complete the job for you **without variables** unless you return variables (or use one of the supported parameter bindings). To make `ANOTHER_KEY` visible downstream, use one of these patterns:

### Pattern A: Keep `autoComplete = true` and **return** variables

```java
@JobWorker(type = "someKindOfWork", autoComplete = true)
public Map<String, Object> someKindOfWork(final ActivatedJob job) throws JsonProcessingException {
  SomeDTO someDTO = objectMapper.readValue((String) job.getVariable(SOME_KEY), SomeDTO.class);

  Map<String, Object> vars = new HashMap<>();
  vars.put(ANOTHER_KEY, true);
  return vars; // Spring Zeebe completes the job and merges these into process variables
}
```

### Pattern B: Set `autoComplete = false` and **complete explicitly** with variables

```java
@JobWorker(type = "someKindOfWork", autoComplete = false)
public void someKindOfWork(final ActivatedJob job, final JobClient client) throws JsonProcessingException {
  SomeDTO someDTO = objectMapper.readValue((String) job.getVariable(SOME_KEY), SomeDTO.class);

  Map<String, Object> vars = Map.of(ANOTHER_KEY, true);
  client.newCompleteCommand(job)
        .variables(vars)
        .send()
        .join(); // Now ANOTHER_KEY is persisted for subsequent steps
}
```

### Pattern C: Use parameter binding (if you prefer)

Spring Zeebe also supports binding variables via annotations (`@Variable`, `@VariablesAsType`) and returning a map/type which the framework will write back on auto-completion.

## 3) Variable scope caveats

* In Camunda 8, variables are **per process instance**, but BPMN **input/output mappings** can copy/filter variables at element boundaries. If an output mapping excludes `ANOTHER_KEY`, a later task might not see it.
* If you’re inside subprocesses/call activities, mapping rules may affect visibility.
* Make sure variable names are agreed and documented (BPMN element docs or team conventions).

## TL;DR

* `SOME_KEY` is likely set earlier, but not necessarily by a worker—don’t assume without checking the model.
* `ANOTHER_KEY` will be available later **only if you complete the job with that variable** (return it when `autoComplete=true`, or pass it in `completeCommand` when `autoComplete=false`).
