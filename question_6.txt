Earlier, when I was studying one of the bpmn files in the codebase, I found conditionExpression like this:

<bpmn:conditionExpression xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression">${SOME_CONDITION}</bpmn:conditionExpression>

, which I asked a few questions about. 

Now I'm taking a look at another bpmn file, which was added by the latest merge to the development branch, and this time, there is no conditionExpression anywhere in the file. 

In this case, which of the followings are conceivable?

1: This bpmn file is incomplete and lacks some logics. 
2: The program flow always enters the prcess defined in this bpmn file, and that's why there is no need to add conditionExpression here. 
3: Any other possibilities?
