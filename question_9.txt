Let's say that there is PreviousWorker.java as well, and it has a program flow like this:

// Do something
// Do another thing

// If a certain condition is met, enter SomeWorker
// Otherwise, do the last thing 

If SomeWorker, which we took a look at previously is triggered like this, will the "last thing" part skipped, 
because PreviousWorker.java and SomeWorker.java are separate files and there is also likely a bpmn file for PreviousWorker.java?
