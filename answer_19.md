Excellent question üëå You‚Äôre now thinking at the **process orchestration level** ‚Äî not just *what happens inside a process*, but also *how processes call each other*. Let‚Äôs break it down.

---

## üîπ Inside one process (e.g. `someProcess`)

As you already said:

* Point **X** = usually an **Exclusive Gateway** in the BPMN.
* Condition **Y** = a condition expression like `${amount > 10000}` or a variable flag.
* Jobs **A** and **B** = represented as service tasks (which map to workers).

üëâ All of this is clearly visible inside the BPMN diagram of `someProcess`.

---

## üîπ Between multiple processes (`initialProcess`, `someProcess`, `anotherProcess`)

There are a few **standard BPMN ways processes link to each other**:

### 1. **Call Activity**

* A task in one process directly calls another process definition.
* In Modeler, it shows as a task with a little ‚Äú+‚Äù marker.
* In XML:

  ```xml
  <bpmn:callActivity id="CallSomeProcess" calledElement="someProcess" />
  ```
* This is the clearest case: `initialProcess` *contains a Call Activity* to start `someProcess`.

### 2. **Message Start Event**

* A process (e.g. `anotherProcess`) starts when it **receives a message**.
* Another process (e.g. `someProcess`) must have a task or event that **sends** that message.
* In Modeler, you‚Äôll see **envelopes** (message icons).
* In XML:

  ```xml
  <bpmn:messageEventDefinition messageRef="StartAnotherProcessMessage"/>
  ```

### 3. **Signal Events**

* Similar to message, but broadcast to whoever listens.
* Less common for tightly-coupled processes.

### 4. **Explicit variable flags**

* Like your example `enterSomeProcess = true`.
* Typically implemented via **conditional sequence flows** after a gateway, or setting variables before a **Call Activity**.

---

## üîπ Where to look to understand relationships

When you want to map how `initialProcess`, `someProcess`, and `anotherProcess` are related:

1. **Open each .bpmn in Modeler.**

   * Look for **Call Activities** ‚Üí these explicitly say ‚Äúrun another process.‚Äù
   * Look for **Message Events** (start events, intermediate events) ‚Üí if one sends and another receives the same message, they‚Äôre connected.
   * Look for **Signal Events** (less likely).
   * Check sequence flows after gateways ‚Üí sometimes a variable flag controls whether a **Call Activity** runs.

2. **Search in code (Java workers).**

   * Look for variables being set (e.g. `vars.put("enterSomeProcess", true)`).
   * These flags usually tie directly to BPMN condition expressions.

3. **Check process IDs.**

   * Each `.bpmn` defines a process with an `id` (e.g. `id="someProcess"`).
   * A Call Activity or start event refers to this ID.
   * So you can literally `grep` for `someProcess` in other `.bpmn` files to find where it‚Äôs called.

## üîπ Example connection

### `initialProcess.bpmn`

```xml
<bpmn:callActivity id="CallSomeProcess" calledElement="someProcess" />
```

### `someProcess.bpmn`

```xml
<bpmn:exclusiveGateway id="CheckCondition"/>
<bpmn:sequenceFlow id="toJobA" sourceRef="CheckCondition" targetRef="JobA">
  <bpmn:conditionExpression xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"><![CDATA[${amount > 10000}]]></bpmn:conditionExpression>
</bpmn:sequenceFlow>
<bpmn:sequenceFlow id="toJobB" sourceRef="CheckCondition" targetRef="JobB">
  <bpmn:conditionExpression xsi:type="bpmn:tFormalExpression"><![CDATA[${amount <= 10000}]]></bpmn:conditionExpression>
</bpmn:sequenceFlow>
```

### `anotherProcess.bpmn`

```xml
<bpmn:startEvent id="StartWithMessage">
  <bpmn:messageEventDefinition messageRef="TriggeredBySomeProcess"/>
</bpmn:startEvent>
```

And in `someProcess`, there might be a **Send Task** or **Message End Event** that sends `TriggeredBySomeProcess`.

---

‚úÖ **So, to answer directly:**
Besides the obvious `enterSomeProcess=true` flags, the main things to look for in `.bpmn` to figure out inter-process connections are:

* **Call Activities** (`calledElement`)
* **Message Events** (start or send/receive)
* **Signal Events** (less common)
* **Process IDs** referenced across files

Would you like me to sketch a **step-by-step checklist** (‚Äúopen X, look for Y‚Äù) so you can systematically trace how your three processes connect in your project?
