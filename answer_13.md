That’s a great practical question — you’re exactly at the point where understanding **how to evolve a BPMN model** meets the use of the **Camunda Modeler tool**. Let’s break it down into a **roadmap**.

---

## 🔹 Roadmap for changing the flow

### 1. Identify the current process definition

* Find the `.bpmn` file in your repo (`src/main/resources/...` usually).
* Open it in **Camunda Modeler** (downloadable free desktop tool).
* You’ll see the current process visually (tasks, arrows, gateways).

---

### 2. Understand the current flow

From your description, the current `.bpmn` looks roughly like:

```
DoSomething → DoAnotherThing → DoLastThing
                               ↘ (if condition) → SomeWorker
```

That means “DoLastThing” **always executes**, and then maybe SomeWorker runs.

---

### 3. Decide new flow

You want:

```
DoSomething → DoAnotherThing → (Gateway)
                           ↙                 ↘
                   condition true       condition false
                     → SomeWorker         → DoLastThing
```

So **Last Thing** becomes *conditional*, and skipped when SomeWorker runs.

---

### 4. Modify in Camunda Modeler

1. Open the `.bpmn` in **Camunda Modeler**.
2. Drag in an **Exclusive Gateway** (diamond shape) after “DoAnotherThing”.
3. Connect the gateway with:

   * A sequence flow to **SomeWorker**.
   * A sequence flow to **DoLastThing**.
4. On each sequence flow, set the **Condition Expression**:

   * To SomeWorker: `${goToSomeWorker}`
   * To LastThing: `${!goToSomeWorker}`
     (variable `goToSomeWorker` comes from your Java worker logic, just like we discussed earlier).
5. Remove the old unconditional arrow from “DoAnotherThing” → “DoLastThing”.

---

### 5. Save and commit the updated `.bpmn`

* The file is still XML, but now it contains new `<bpmn:exclusiveGateway>` and `<bpmn:conditionExpression>` tags.
* Commit this new `.bpmn` file to version control.

---

### 6. Update Java worker if needed

* In `PreviousWorker.java`, when you complete the job, you must provide the boolean flag:

  ```java
  vars.put("goToSomeWorker", condition);
  client.newCompleteCommand(job).variables(vars).send().join();
  ```
* That way, the gateway in BPMN knows which branch to take.

---

### 7. Deploy and test

* Camunda automatically deploys the `.bpmn` when your app starts if the file is in `resources/`.
* Start a new process instance.
* In Operate, verify that:

  * If condition is true → “DoLastThing” is skipped, “SomeWorker” runs.
  * If condition is false → “SomeWorker” is skipped, “DoLastThing” runs.

---

## 🔹 Tools you’ll use

* **Camunda Modeler**: edit `.bpmn` visually (drag/drop).
* **Java Worker code**: set the decision variable.
* **Operate UI**: verify the runtime behavior.

---

✅ **Summary**:
To change the flow, you don’t hand-edit XML. You open the `.bpmn` file in **Camunda Modeler**, insert an exclusive gateway, redraw sequence flows, and condition them. Then adjust the Java worker to supply the flag. Deploy and test.

Would you like me to draw the **“before vs after” BPMN diagram** (ASCII-style or XML snippet) so you can see the structural difference more concretely?
