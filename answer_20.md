Nice find 👌 You’ve just uncovered a **Call Activity relationship** between two BPMN files. Let’s unpack it.

---

### 🔹 What you saw

In `anotherProcess.bpmn`:

```xml
<bpmn:process id="Process_anotherProcess" name="anotherProcess" isExecutable="true">
```

That defines the process — its ID is `Process_anotherProcess`.

---

In `somethingRelated.bpmn`:

```xml
<zeebe:calledElement processId="Process_anotherProcess" propagateAllChileVariables="false" />
```

That’s Camunda 8’s way of saying:
“This activity will call another BPMN process whose ID is `Process_anotherProcess`.”

---

### 🔹 What this means

* `somethingRelated.bpmn` contains a **Call Activity**.
* That Call Activity is configured to start the process defined in `anotherProcess.bpmn`.
* So the flow is:

  ```
  somethingRelated.bpmn
       |
       └── Call Activity → runs anotherProcess.bpmn
  ```
* In plain words: **`somethingRelated` launches `anotherProcess`** when execution reaches that task.

---

### 🔹 About `propagateAllChildVariables="false"`

* Default in Camunda 8 Call Activities is to pass all parent variables into the child process.
* Here it’s explicitly turned **off**.
  Meaning: only explicitly mapped variables are handed over, not everything in the parent context.
* That prevents the child process from being “polluted” with all parent variables.

---

### ✅ So your situation is:

* `anotherProcess` doesn’t run on its own.
* It’s triggered **indirectly** when `somethingRelated` reaches a Call Activity pointing to `Process_anotherProcess`.

👉 Would you like me to show you how to **trace what variables actually get passed** into `anotherProcess` when it’s called this way? That would help understand *how the two processes exchange data*.
