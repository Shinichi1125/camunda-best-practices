Let's say that there is an existing .bpmn file, and the current version of PreviousWorker expects this program flow:

// Do something 
// Do another thing 
// Do the last thing (always executed)
// If a certain condition is met, enter SomeWorker 

And let's say that the program flow above is to be changed like this:

// Do something 
// Do another thing 
// If a certain condition is met, enter SomeWorker 
// Otherwise, do the last thing (skipped if it enters SomeWorker)

In a case scenario like this, how do I make the change?
As the existing .bpmn file was most likely auto-generated, I assume there should be a tool to generate it. 

Can you first show me a roadmap, including the usage of the tool as well?
