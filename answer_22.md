Perfect 👍 — this is where **Camunda Operate** really shines because you can see not just *one* process instance, but also **called process instances**. Let’s go step by step:

---

## 🔹 How to trace a Call Activity chain in Operate

1. **Trigger the parent process**

   * Start a new instance of `somethingRelated` (whatever normally triggers it — e.g. a REST call, a test, or manually from Tasklist/Operate).
   * This is the process that contains the `<zeebe:calledElement processId="Process_anotherProcess" .../>`.

2. **Open Operate**

   * Go to `http://localhost:8080/operate`.
   * Find your running/finished instance of `somethingRelated`.

3. **Drill into the instance**

   * Click on the instance of `somethingRelated`.
   * You’ll see the process diagram on the right and the execution state on the left (tokens moving through tasks).

4. **Locate the Call Activity**

   * In the diagram of `somethingRelated`, find the task that represents the Call Activity (should look like a task with a **small plus (+) marker** in the bottom center).
   * When execution reaches that Call Activity, a **new instance of another process** will be created.

5. **View called process instances**

   * In the **instance view**, Operate shows links to “**Called Process Instances**.”
   * You’ll usually see a little expandable section under the Call Activity showing:
     👉 `Called Process: Process_anotherProcess`
   * Click it, and Operate will navigate you to the instance of `anotherProcess` that was spawned.

6. **Inspect `anotherProcess`**

   * Now you’re inside the execution of `anotherProcess`.
   * You’ll see `Activity_A`, `Activity_B`, etc. highlighted as they execute.

7. **Navigate back**

   * Operate lets you go back up to the parent process (`somethingRelated`) so you can trace the full chain:

     ```
     somethingRelated → (Call Activity) → anotherProcess
     ```

## 🔹 What this gives you

* Visual confirmation that **`somethingRelated` triggers `anotherProcess`**.
* Insight into the **timing**: e.g., whether `anotherProcess` starts immediately or after a condition.
* The **variables passed into the child process** (you can inspect them in Operate’s variable view).

✅ **So in practice**:
You don’t need to guess whether `anotherProcess` runs — you can run the parent, open Operate, and *literally click through* from parent to child process instances.

👉 Do you want me to also show you how to **check which variables got passed** from `somethingRelated` into `anotherProcess` inside Operate? That’s often the next step when debugging Call Activities.
