Perfect 👍 let’s take your `Flow_123abc` example and turn it into a **minimal diagram** so you can “see” how the IDs wire shapes together.

---

### 🔹 Snippets you shared

```xml
<bpmn:exclusiveGateway id="Gateway_0123hmf" name="some worker type" default="Flow_123abc">
  <bpmn:incoming>Flow_XYZ</bpmn:incoming>
  <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_123abc</bpmn:outgoing>
  <bpmn:outgoing>Flow_ABC</bpmn:outgoing>
</bpmn:exclusiveGateway>

<bpmndi:BPMNEdge id="Flow_123abc" bpmnElement="Flow_123abc"/>
```

---

### 🔹 How it looks conceptually (ASCII diagram)

```
   [Task Before Gateway]
            |
         Flow_XYZ
            v
      +-------------------+
      | Exclusive Gateway |
      |  (Gateway_0123hmf)|
      +-------------------+
        /           \
       /             \
Flow_123abc        Flow_ABC
(default)           (condition)
     v                 v
 [Task_Default]   [Task_Alternative]
```

### 🔹 What’s happening

1. **Incoming flow**

   * `Flow_XYZ` leads **into** the gateway.
   * That means some previous task or event was connected with an arrow named `Flow_XYZ`.

2. **Gateway**

   * The gateway (ID = `Gateway_0123hmf`) has two **outgoing arrows**:

     * `Flow_123abc` → the **default** path (taken when no other conditions match).
     * `Flow_ABC` → a conditional path (e.g., `${amount > 1000}`).

3. **Outgoing tasks**

   * `Flow_123abc` points to the “default” task (`Task_Default`).
   * `Flow_ABC` points to an alternative task (`Task_Alternative`).

4. **BPMNEdge**

   * `<bpmndi:BPMNEdge>` with ID `Flow_123abc` is just the diagram data that says:
     👉 “draw an arrow from Gateway\_0123hmf to Task\_Default.”

---

### 🔹 Real-life parallel

Think of this as a **traffic light**:

* **Flow\_XYZ** = the road going into the intersection.
* **Gateway\_0123hmf** = the traffic light deciding where cars go.
* **Flow\_123abc** = the default straight-ahead road.
* **Flow\_ABC** = the side road you take only if the traffic light is green for turning.

---

✅ So now you can “read” a BPMN file as:

* **Tasks** = work units (trigger workers).
* **Gateways** = decisions.
* **Flows (IDs)** = arrows between them.
* **BPMNEdge** = how to draw the arrow (UI only).

---

Would it help if I showed you the **exact XML for the whole minimal example** (start → gateway → 2 tasks), so you can see how `Flow_123abc` threads through *all* sections at once?
