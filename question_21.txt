As for anotherProcess's .bpmn file, other than the ID "Process_anotherProcess", I've found a few more IDs:
- id="Activity_A"
- id="Activity_B"

Again, I've searched the entire project, but this time, I only found Activity_A and Activity_B within anotherProcess .bpmn file itself. 

Does this suggest that there is no process that calls anotherProcess under any condition at this moment?
