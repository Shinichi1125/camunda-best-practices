Can you explain how IDs in bpmn files work?

Let's say that I see results like this when I run grep Flow_123abc someProcess.bpmn:

<bpmn:incoming>Flow_123abc</bpmn:incoming>
<bpmn:exclusiveGateway id="Gateway_0123hmf" name="some worker type" default="Flow_123abc">

<bpmn:outgoing>Flow_123abc</bpmn:outgoing>
<bpmndi:BPMNEdge id="Flow_123abc" bpmnElement="Flow_123abc">

Given these pieces of information, including keywords like "incoming", "outgoing", "exclusiveGateway", "default", "BPMNEdge" etc, 
tell me how they are related to each other, along with a few concrete real life examples.
