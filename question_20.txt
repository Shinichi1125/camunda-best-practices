Now I'm having a look at anotherProcess's .bpmn file. 

It has the following definition:

<bpmn:process id="Process_anotherProcess" name="anotherProcess" isExecutable="true">

When I searched the entire project, other than this file itself, the only file that contained "Process_anotherProcess" was somethingRelated.bpmn:

<zeebe:calledElement processId="Process_anotherProcess" propagateAllChileVariables="false" />

What does this suggest?
