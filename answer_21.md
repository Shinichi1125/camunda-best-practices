Let’s break this down carefully 👇

---

### 🔹 Process-level ID

```xml
<bpmn:process id="Process_anotherProcess" ...>
```

* This ID is what other processes (via **Call Activities**) or external code (via **startProcessInstance**) would use to start this process.
* You already saw `somethingRelated.bpmn` referencing this with:

  ```xml
  <zeebe:calledElement processId="Process_anotherProcess" .../>
  ```

  ✅ That *does* prove that `anotherProcess` **can be called** by `somethingRelated`.

---

### 🔹 Activity-level IDs

```xml
<bpmn:serviceTask id="Activity_A" .../>
<bpmn:serviceTask id="Activity_B" .../>
```

* These are **internal node IDs** inside `anotherProcess`.
* They uniquely identify tasks (service tasks, user tasks, gateways, etc.).
* They are usually **not referenced outside** the process — they’re for the engine to track execution.
* You typically won’t find `Activity_A` or `Activity_B` used in Java or other BPMN files.
  (The only exception: if your team hardcodes activity IDs somewhere, e.g. in tests or custom queries — but that’s rare and not recommended.)

---

### 🔹 What your search results mean

* The fact that `Activity_A` and `Activity_B` appear **only in `anotherProcess.bpmn`** is normal.
* That does **not** mean “anotherProcess is unused.”
* It just means that no other process or code references the *individual tasks* inside `anotherProcess` directly.
* The whole process is invoked as a unit via its **process ID** (`Process_anotherProcess`), not via its task IDs.

---

### ✅ Conclusion

* **Yes**, `anotherProcess` is being called (because `somethingRelated.bpmn` references its process ID).
* **No**, the fact that task IDs `Activity_A` and `Activity_B` don’t show up elsewhere does **not** mean it’s unused.
  It just means tasks inside `anotherProcess` are self-contained and only triggered once the process itself runs.

---

👉 If you want to be 100% sure when `anotherProcess` actually executes in practice, the best way is:

* Run the system.
* Start a process instance of `somethingRelated` in Operate.
* Watch whether `anotherProcess` shows up as a **called process instance**.

Would you like me to show you exactly how to trace a **Call Activity chain in Operate** so you can visually confirm “yes, this process triggered anotherProcess”?
