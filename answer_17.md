Yes âœ… â€” exactly.

What you have there:

```
camunda8-run-8.7-windows-x86_64
```

is the **Camunda 8 Run distribution** (the runtime bundle: Zeebe, Operate, Tasklist, etc.). Thatâ€™s the *engine + monitoring UI*, not the modeling tool.

The **diagram editor (Camunda Modeler)** is a **separate desktop app** â€” itâ€™s not included in `camunda8-run-*` and wonâ€™t show up in that folder.

---

### ðŸ”¹ To check if Modeler is installed

* On Windows, look in **Start Menu** â†’ search for "Camunda Modeler".
* On macOS, check **Applications**.
* On Linux, check your package manager or look for a `camunda-modeler` binary.

Since your `ls ~/Downloads` only shows the run distribution, it seems you never installed the Modeler.

### ðŸ”¹ What to do

1. Download Camunda Modeler from:
   ðŸ‘‰ [https://camunda.com/download/modeler/](https://camunda.com/download/modeler/)

2. Install it on your OS.

3. Open it and then open your `.bpmn` file (from your project repo, usually under `src/main/resources/`).

---

âœ… So yes â€” your environment currently has the **runtime**, but itâ€™s **missing the modeling tool**.

Would you like me to give you the **direct step-by-step for installing Camunda Modeler on Windows 11** so you can get it running alongside your existing Camunda 8 setup?
