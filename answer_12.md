Good eye ðŸ‘€ â€” letâ€™s separate the two cases:

---

### ðŸ”¹ **pom.xml**

* In Spring Boot, `pom.xml` can indeed be **auto-generated** (e.g. via Spring Initializr), but after that, devs usually edit it manually (add dependencies, tweak plugins).
* Itâ€™s structured XML but *meant for humans to edit* as well as tools.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **.bpmn files**

* In Camunda, **.bpmn files are almost always created/edited with a graphical tool** (Camunda Modeler, or sometimes another BPMN editor).
* When you drag arrows and drop gateways in the Modeler, it writes XML under the hood.
* Those IDs like `Flow_123abc`, `Activity_0lsk7fg` are **auto-generated by the Modeler**.
* Most teams donâ€™t write `.bpmn` XML by hand, because:

  * Itâ€™s verbose and easy to mess up.
  * The diagram is meant to be *visual* â€” the diagram is the single source of truth, not just the XML text.

---

### ðŸ”¹ But can you edit by hand?

* Yes, `.bpmn` is just XML, and you can edit it in a text editor (like `pom.xml`).
* Sometimes people tweak IDs, add extension properties, or script conditions directly in the XML.
* But the **normal workflow is visual modeling** in Camunda Modeler, then version-control the `.bpmn` file (the XML).

---

### âœ… Comparison

* `pom.xml`: human-editable config file thatâ€™s partially bootstrapped but often maintained manually.
* `.bpmn`: machine-readable XML, *usually auto-generated/maintained via the visual Modeler*, not hand-crafted.

---

ðŸ‘‰ So to answer directly:
Yes, `.bpmn` files are **usually auto-generated** (by Camunda Modeler), unlike `pom.xml` which is often hand-edited. You can technically hand-write `.bpmn` files, but in practice teams use the Modeler for clarity and accuracy.

---

Would you like me to show you a **before/after example** of the same process as *drawn visually in Modeler* vs. *what the raw `.bpmn` XML looks like*? That contrast usually makes it click.
