In the context of Camunda, when you have a method in XxxWorker.java file like this: 

@JobWorker(type = "someKindOfWork", autoComplete = true)
public void someKindOfWork(ActivatedJob job, JobClient client) throws JsonProcessingException {
  SomeDTO someDTO = objectMapper.readValue((String) job.getVariable(SOME_KEY), SomeDTO.class);

  variableMap.put(ANOTHER_KEY, true);
  ......
}

Can you assume that: 

- the variable obtained by SOME_KEY has already been stored in another method (of possibly another Worker file)
- the variable stored by put with the key ANOTHER_KEY is likely to be referenced in another Worker

?
