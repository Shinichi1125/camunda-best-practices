I've been using Elasticsearch for a few months, and it had been working fine until yesterday. 
For some reason, it suddenly stopped working yesterday. 

Ordinarily, after starting Elasticsearch by ./c8run.exe start command on my Windows machine, 
I could run a Java program, make a POST request with a JSON body file, 
after which either running (green) or failed (red) processes appear in the UI of the Operate dashboard. 

After it stopped working properly, neither one of green and red process appear. 
I checked the console of the Java program, but no error or expection was observed. 

Here is a set of tweaks that I have tried: 
- Rebooting the PC
- Removing the existing Camunda and reinstalling a newer version (previous: 8.7.2, new one: 8.7.11)
- Also making sure that redundant files / folders are removed:
  * connector-runtime-bundle-8.7.2-with-dependencies.jar (removed)
  * connector-runtime-bundle-8.7.7-with-dependencies.jar
  * camunda-zeebe-8.7.2/ (removed)
  * camunda-zeebe-8.7.11/
- Rebooting the PC once again

, but after all of them still the same symptom remains. 

I ran grep -r -i error under camunda8-run-8.7-windows-x86_64/c8run/log folder, and all of the 3 files: 
- camunda.log
- connectors.log
- elasticsearch.log
contain error messages. 

I'll raise a few examples:

[camunda.log]
ERROR:
io.camunda.operate.zeebeimport.elasticsearch.ElasticsearchRecordsReader - Exception occurred for alias [zeebe-record-decision-requirements], 
while obtaining next Zeebe records batch: Some ES shards failed. Ignoring search response and retrying, to prevent data loss. 

[connectors.log]
ERROR:
i.c.c.r.i.i.ProcessDefinitionImporter: Failed to import process elements

[elasticsearch.log]
--add-modules=jdk.incubator.vector, -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError, -XX:+ExitOnOutOfMemoryError, -XX:HeapDumpPath=data, -XX:ErrorFile=logs/hs_err_pid%p.log,

What should I focus on to debug this?
